# Recoverability-in-AWS
build a multi-availability zone, multi-region database. You will demonstrate how applications can use this distributed infrastructure and migrate your primary database from one geographical region to another. You will also create a versioned website and demonstrate how it is protected from accidental or malicious disruption, with an ability to turn-back-the-clock when something disrupts your normal operations.
